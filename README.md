# Pokedex

This is the URL: https://svegadolugar.github.io/Pokedex/

It was made with ReactJS.

To create a GitHub page with this, you can follow the instructions in this page:
https://platzi.com/tutoriales/1548-react/4065-guia-para-usar-github-pages-en-tus-proyectos-de-reactjs/
  -sorry it's in Spanish, but you can use google translate. -

After that, you need to go yo the " gh-pages " branch in your Git Repository,
in the file " index.html " you must change the script source to " bundle.js " instead " ./bundle.js "

Then, in your repository, go to settings >> Pages and you need to select the folder " /(root) "
